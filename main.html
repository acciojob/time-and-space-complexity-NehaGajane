	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

	<p>
		Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a 
		function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the 
		actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on. Helps make the code efficient.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>space complexity</b> of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of 
		the length of the input. Consider an example: Suppose a problem to find the frequency of array elements.
		It can be said that the space complexity is O(N).
